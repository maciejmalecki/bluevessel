# bluevessel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maciejmalecki/bluevessel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maciejmalecki/bluevessel)

BlueVessel is my first official C64 intro (calling it a demo would be a bit too much) that I completed in ca 2hrs using c64lib. I plan to 
give it as an addition to C64C that I have prepared for my collegue. Why it is about vessel and why it's blue - he'll know ;-)

This intro is released in form of PRG file that can be either launched using C64 emulator (i.e. Vice) or by running on real hardware 
(preferred).

## how to compile

This intro is written with KickAssembler and can be compiled with KA version 5.0. It requires however few libraries to be checked out into libdir:
